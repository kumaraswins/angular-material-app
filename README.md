This repository has a sample angular material application with the route providers. I have not used any of the bower components nor the CDN, just download the repository and run the appliaction on a server.

This gives a basic overview of how the angular material app works. It is designed such way that we can straight away use for single page application. I will be adding the common functionalities, directive, services frequently. Please take update frequently to get the new updates. Your valuble comments are welcome.
